# Shockers
At OpenShock we support a couple of different Shocker Models. All of them are based on 433 MHz RF for communication.  
They are controlled via a OpenShock Hub.

## Where to buy them

We recommend the [CaiXianlin](caixianlin.md) Shocker due to it being cheap and accessible to buy from AliExpress.  
We have a couple of offers from AliExpress linked on the [CaiXianlin Shocker Page](caixianlin.md)

## Supported Shockers

We currently support the following Shockers:

- [CaiXianlin](caixianlin.md) (**✅ recommended ⭐**)
- [Petrainer](petrainer.md) (discontinued)
- Petrainer 998DR (unknown availability)
