# Shockers

!!! warning "Import restrictions"
    Shockers are advertised as shock collars for use on animals, which is considered illegal by EU law.

    Importing these products to your country might be restricted because of this.

    As an alternative, you can proxy your parcels via a country that does not closely monitor these product imports, such as the Netherlands or Luxembourg.

    List of known results:
