This guide mainly focuses on the parts listed in the [Hardware Buy guide](../quickstart/buying-guide.md).

## Requirements

+ ESP-32
+ 433 MHz transmitter
+ Soldering station
+ Hookup wire (optional, depending on whether the pins line up)

## What/Where to buy?

See the [Hardware Buy guide here](../quickstart/buying-guide.md). For the board/ESP-32 assembly you need the ESP-32 and a 433 MHz transmitter.

## Figuring out the PINs

Any digital output pin on your micro-controller should work for outputting the signal for the transmitter, however the default is often close to the positive and ground pins on the controller. See the [boards](../hardware/boards/index.md) section dedicated to the micro-controller you are using to decide which pin to use.
