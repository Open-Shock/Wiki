## Over the Air Update (Recommended)
1. Login to [OpenShock.app](https://openshock.app/)

4. Select "OTA Update".

5. Now you can see 3 different branches of firmware, these are "Develop", "Stable" and "Beta". **We recommend that you only use the Stable branch if you don't know what you're doing.**
6. If your firmware version is older than the one displayed on the "Stable" button, you should update.

7. Click the "Stable" button. 
8. Confirm the Update.
9. Your Device should now update automatically, don't close the website during this.  
After it's done it should restart your Device and everything should just workâ„¢.

    If the update is not successful the updater will not overwrite anything and your Device should just stay on the old version.  
    Ask on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/OpenShock) for help.

## Using a Flash tool
This basically means re-flashing your firmware with a newer version, like it is explained in the [How to flash the firmware](../guides/openshock-how-to-flash-your-board.md) guide.  
**Doing it this way will also reset all your configuration.**
