# How to flash the firmware

## What you need

- [OpenShock hub](../hardware/boards/index.md)
- A Chromium based web-browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc.) **Firefox will not work since it doesn't support Web Serial**
- [Our Flashtool](https://next.openshock.app/flashtool)

!!! warning "Important"
    Ensure you have a cable that supports data transfer, and neither the port nor cable is damaged.

!!! Info
    If you recieved your hub from an OpenShock hardware vendor, you can likely skip this step! Any updates can be [performed wirelessly](../guides/openshock-how-to-update.md) after the initial setup.

## Flashing the firmware
1. Plug your hub into your PC using a USB cable.
2. Open the [Flashtool](https://next.openshock.app/flashtool).
3. Click "Select Device" and select your hub in the Popup window.  
If your hub is not showing up click on "Install Drivers", after that repeat this step.
