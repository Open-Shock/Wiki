!!! question "What is a Share code?"
    Share codes make it possible for someone with a Shocklink.net account to directly control your shocker with their account.  
!!! Info "Share codes can only be used once! " 
    You need to generate a new code every time you want to share the controls of your shocker with a new person.
    Shares are permanent until unshared/deleted by the owner of the shocker.
