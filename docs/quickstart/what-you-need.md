# What you need

If you've found yourself here, chances are you're either looking to get shocked, or shock a friend or partner! We've written this quick start guide to help you get shocking as fast as possible.

## Requirements

To get started with OpenShock, you need three things:

### 1. An OpenShock server

This can be either a public or private OpenShock server. We recommend the [openshock.app](https://openshock.app) public OpenShock instance.

Interested in hosting your own server? Check out the [Self-hosting](../guides/selfhosting/index.md) guide.

### 2. An OpenShock hub

A hub connects OpenShock to the shock device via a micro-controller and a 433 MHz transmitter.

- For pre-built options, check out the [Hardware vendors](../vendors/hardware/index.md).
- For building your own [DIY Buying guide](../diy/hardware-buying.md).

### 3. Shockers

See [Shockers](../hardware/shockers/index.md). We recommend the [CaiXianlin](../hardware/shockers/caixianlin.md) shockers.
